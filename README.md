## Project description
My project is a simple client-server desktop messenger. This messenger will include features such as user authorization and the ability to create chats and groups with other users. The project will be written in C#. The messenger will have a simple UI. For data storage, Iâ€™ll use a remote database, which will be connected to the desktop application through the server. The server will also be implemented in C# and will be a separate application from the client. It will be used for sending data to the database and retrieving data from it. The server will send information from the client not only to the database, but also to other users to whom this information is relevant. For example, if you send a message to the chat, it will not only be saved in the database, but also sent to other members of this chat in real time.
