## Project description
My project is a simple client-server desktop messenger. This messenger will contain some functions like user authorization and creating chats and groups with other users. This project will be written using C#. This messenger will contain simple UI. For data storaging I'll use remote database, which will be connected with desktop application throught the server. Server will be realized using C# too and will be a separate application from the client. It will be used for sending data to DB and getting data from here. Server will send information from client not only to the database, but for the other users to whom this information applies (f.e. if you send message to the chat, it will be not only saved in db, but also sended to other members of this chat in real time).
